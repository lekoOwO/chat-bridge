# Chat Bridge
A chat bridge between Telegram, Messenger and IRC.

## Usage
`$ node main.js`

The first time you execute this, it'll generate `config.json` automatically.

Configurate it correctlly and run it.

If Messenger is configurated, the first boot after it's configurated will save the session of Messenger and shut itself down automatically. Don't panic, just boot it again and it's all right.
